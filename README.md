## Introduction

Drowsy driving is a major cause of road accidents, especially during nighttime when visibility is reduced. The Drowsiness Detection System is an intelligent solution that can help drivers remain vigilant by constantly monitoring their facial features and eye movements. If the system detects signs of drowsiness, such as closed eyes or prolonged eye closure, it triggers an alarm to alert the driver and prompt them to take a break or rest.

## Features

Real-time facial detection and landmark tracking.
Eye state monitoring to detect drowsiness.
Beeping alarm to wake the driver in case of drowsiness.
User-friendly interface for easy interaction.

## Dependencies

The Drowsiness Detection System relies on the following libraries:

cv2 (OpenCV) 
numpy 
streamlit
keras
pygame
tensorflow
